                    O’Hare and Midway are probably the first associations that pop to your mind when you hear the words

                    travelers!</p>
                <h4>Chicago O’Hare International Airport (ORD)</h4>
                <p>Also known as Chicago O’Hare or O’Hare, this giant is the fourth busiest airport in the world,
                    serving more than 54 million people in 2021. Of course, this is the main airport in the Chicago
                    area. It’s located northwest of Chicago Downtown, about 17 miles from the Loop. You won’t be bored
